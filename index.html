<p><h3>Educational Research</h3><p>
At foundry10, I conduct educational research looking at how people learn within complex social environments, across fields like virtual reality, hip hop dance, digital audio, and teacher professional development. My work describes how people construct their own understanding of the world and their place in it, assesses the value of digital technology tools in education, encourages creativity in the arts, and incorporates student voice into ed research. I aim to bring curiosity and compassion to my research and work. Here are some of my favorite methods and tools for ed research:     
<ul><li>Network analysis: In collaboration with Young Women Empowered (Y-WE), a young women's leadership camp, I conduct service design research, analyzing ethnographic and network data to study and track year-over-year outcomes in community building, staff experience, and support structures. Here's a demo slide deck showing how network analysis can be used for program evaluation.
<li>Cognitive interviews: Cognitive walkthroughs are a useful method to help understand what your survey measures are actually measuring, and to make changes with rapid iterative testing. Here's a poster presentation showing ...
<li>Experimental user experience research: foundry10 presented the results of this study at GDC 2018, a prominent game developer conference. <a href="https://gdcvault.com/play/1025337/Who-Am-I-Role-and">Here's the slide deck</a> from that presentation and the <a href="https://gdcvault.com/play/1024887/Who-Am-I-Role-and">video presentation</a>. 
<li>Persona research using survey data and cluster analysis (machine learning): While technology use in schools is fairly widespread, there is a clear 'usage gap', where some teachers use technology for student creation, exploration, and collaboration, while others primarily use technology for lower-level uses such as passive media consumption and test-taking. We collected survey responses from teachers across Washington State, identified distinct teacher personas based on their use of technology, and made recommendations for targeted teacher professional development.
<li>Mixed methods ethnography: in education research, it's important to understand how people develop skills through teamwork and social interaction. In <a href="http://www.foundry10.org/research/teamwork-based-developmental-outcomes-in-student-led-high-school-dance">a study looking at high school hip hop dance teams</a>, we interviewed youth about their team experiences, coded the interviews, and conducted quantitative analyses on the coded results. In another study, we <a href="http://www.foundry10.org/research/women-in-auto">interviewed women who work in the auto industry and presented</a> at auto industry conferences on how educational factors like mentorship and professional development impacted their career. 
</ul>

<p><h3>Health Outcomes Research</h3><p>

At Health Research Associates, I was a formidable blend of user experience researcher, ethnographer, analyst, project manager, and writer, directly interfacing with both medical patients and clients. Below are some representative projects I've led. (Please note that HRA's research activities are, in some cases, subject to sponsors' confidentiality requirements.) 

<ul><li>I was the project lead at HRA for the <a href="http://c-path.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/2015_NSCLC_WG_Poster.pdf">PRO Consortium's Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) study</a>, a multi-sponsor effort to develop a lung cancer symptom inventory that can be used to support labeling claims. Through 2016, I managed the study's literature review, protocol development, qualitative research, item generation, electronic product development (through a 3rd-party vendor), report writing, and dissemination (example posters <a href="https://github.com/scanlonm/Posters-and-articles/blob/master/Poster%201097%20-%20Scanlon%20et%20al%20-%20NSCLC%20Breathing%20Sx.pdf">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/scanlonm/Posters-and-articles/blob/master/Poster1091_McCarrier_etal_NSCLCSymptoms.pdf">here</a>)
<li>I believe collaborative research leads to innovative ideas and effective solutions. I’ve <b>facilitated strategy and consulting workshops</b> bringing together clients’ clinical, marketing, IT, and strategy teams, as well as key opinion leaders in the relevant field, with the goal of driving strategy and developing measurement solutions for Fortune 500 companies that keep the end users’ experiences and needs in mind. As an example, I was the project lead for a study driving internal strategy for a mid-sized pharmaceutical company's existing products for a psycho-neurological condition, with the intention of understanding the product experience from the patient's perspective. My study activities included literature review, facilitation of an internal workshop defining company's needs, interviews with clinical key opinion leaders, interviews with patients, analysis (qualitative and quantitative segmentation and comparison), and facilitation of an internal workshop outlining results. 
<li>I developed a unique <b>concept mapping</b> approach to investigating the meaning of words patients use to describe their pain, and showed that specific words have context-dependent meaning that varies across patient conditions.

<p><h3>Statistics</h3><p>

In my research I've made use of the following statistical methods:
<ul>
<li>Descriptive statistics
<li>Normalization
<li>T-tests (single sample, repeated samples, independent measures)
<li>ANOVAs (single factor, two-factor, repeated measures, smoothing splines)
<li>Correlation (Pearson, Spearman)
<li>Chi-square (goodness of fit, test of independence)
<li>Regression (simple, multiple, logit, multilevel modeling, SEM)
<li>Social network analysis (centrality, distance, clustering, visualization) and cognitive mapping
<li>Factor analysis (EFA, CFA)
<li>Machine learning (cluster analysis)
</ul>
