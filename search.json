This page showcases some of the methods I’ve used.\r\nExperimental user experience research\r\n I was the research lead for an experimental study looking at engagement, empathy, and narrative with commercial virtual reality experiences. I lead experimental design, data collection, and analysis for the study. We presented the results of this study at GDC 2018, a prominent game developer conference, and at CHI 2018, a leading conference on computer-human interaction.\r\n\r\nVideo presentation from GDC 2018 and slide deck\r\n\r\nArticle in CHI Proceedings\r\nUsability testing for products in development\r\nI designed usability and feasibility research for a prototype web application to help teachers and school administrators evaluate the impact of esports in schools. The usability data helped our client earn a Phase II Small Business Innovation Research grant.\r\nCompetitive analysis\r\nI was the project lead for a study driving internal strategy for a mid-sized pharmaceutical company’s existing products for a psycho-neurological condition, with the intention of understanding the product experience from the patient’s perspective. My study activities included literature review, facilitation of an internal workshop defining company’s needs, interviews with clinical key opinion leaders, interviews with patients, analysis (qualitative and quantitative segmentation and comparison), industry presentations, and facilitation of an internal workshop outlining results.\r\nCluster analysis\r\n While technology use in schools is fairly widespread, there is a clear ‘usage gap’, where some teachers use technology for student creation, exploration, and collaboration, while others primarily use technology for lower-level uses such as passive media consumption and test-taking. Foundry10 collected survey responses from teachers across Washington State, identified distinct teacher personas based on their use of technology, and made recommendations for targeted teacher professional development. My role for this project was survey development, analysis, and writing. Preprint - article under review.\r\nEthnography and network analysis\r\n In collaboration with Young Women Empowered (Y-WE), a young women’s leadership camp, foundry10 conducts service design research. I analyze ethnographic and network data to study year-over-year outcomes in community building, staff experience, and support structures.\r\n\r\nPoster presentation - Links between social support and relationship quality in a group mentoring context\r\n\r\nQualitative article - “Here I can just be myself”: How youth and adults collaboratively develop an identity-safe community across difference\r\n\r\nDemo slide deck showing how network analysis can be used for program evaluation.\r\nSurvey development\r\nI was the project lead at Health Research Associates for the PRO Consortium’s Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) study, a multi-sponsor effort to develop a lung cancer symptom inventory that can be used to support labeling claims. Through 2016, I managed the study’s literature review, protocol development, qualitative research, item generation, electronic product development (through a 3rd-party vendor), report writing, and dissemination (example posters here and here).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
