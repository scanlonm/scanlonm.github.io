### Thanks for visiting!
Welcome to my personal site! I am a mixed methods researcher working in education research at foundry10, a philanthropic educational research organization. Throughout my career I've worked as a qualitative, quantitative, and mixed-methods scientist in education and health research, and my work has consistently focused on developing tools to document peopleâ€™s experiences in practical contexts. Check out a smattering of my projects on my Projects tab.
  
  
**Let's collaborate!**  
Do you want to geek out over measurement, coding, or group learning? Interested in having me talk at your organization or group? Do you have an idea how we could work together? Email me!
